**Title:** An LLM-Enhanced Clinical Decision Support System for Malaria Diagnosis in Resource-Limited Settings: A Hybrid Approach

Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit our manuscript for consideration for publication in JMIR Medical Informatics. This work presents a novel hybrid approach combining rule-based classification with large language models (LLMs) for malaria diagnosis, achieving 87.22% diagnostic accuracy—a 56.60 percentage point improvement over traditional rule-based systems.

## Significance and Innovation

**Clinical Impact:** Malaria causes approximately 600,000 deaths annually, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa where access to specialist physicians is limited. Our system addresses this critical gap by providing accurate, explainable diagnostic support suitable for deployment in rural health posts and resource-limited settings.

**Technical Innovation:** While prior LLM healthcare research has focused on image analysis or general medical question-answering, our work demonstrates:
- First implementation of a hybrid rule-based + LLM system for malaria diagnosis
- Novel approach using free, offline LLM deployment (Ollama/Llama 3.1)
- Privacy-preserving architecture with no external API dependencies
- 100% detection rate for critical life-threatening cases

**Validation:** Evaluated on 1,682 real-world and synthetic cases across four severity stages, demonstrating robust performance suitable for clinical deployment.

## Relevance to JMIR Medical Informatics

This manuscript aligns with your journal's focus on:
1. **AI in Healthcare:** Novel application of LLMs in clinical decision support
2. **Digital Health in LMICs:** Designed specifically for resource-limited settings
3. **Explainable AI:** Natural language reasoning enhances clinician trust
4. **Implementation Science:** Practical, deployable system with clear clinical utility

## Key Findings

- **87.22% overall diagnostic accuracy** (vs 30.62% baseline)
- **100% critical case detection** (perfect safety record)
- **98.9% Stage I malaria detection** (enabling early intervention)
- **6.3 seconds processing time** (suitable for clinical workflow)
- **Zero API costs** (sustainable for low-resource deployment)

## Ethical Considerations

This research:
- Uses publicly available datasets (Kaggle + synthetic data)
- Does not involve human subjects directly (computational study)
- Presents system as decision support, not autonomous diagnosis
- Includes comprehensive discussion of limitations and safety measures
- Does not require IRB approval (retrospective computational analysis)

## Data and Code Availability

In accordance with JMIR open science policies:
- **Full source code:** https://github.com/jemiridaniel/malaria-llm-cdss (MIT License)
- **Dataset:** Kaggle Malaria Diagnosis Dataset (publicly available)
- **Synthetic data:** Included in GitHub repository
- **All evaluation results:** Available in supplementary materials

## Conflicts of Interest

No conflicts of interest to declare. This work was conducted independently without industry funding or commercial interests.

## Prior Presentations

This work has not been previously published or submitted elsewhere. It represents a substantial evolution and modernization of an undergraduate final year project completed at Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO), Imo State, Nigeria in 2020. The current work (2025) includes entirely new methodology (LLM integration), comprehensive evaluation on 1,682 cases, and extensive analysis—representing a novel contribution to the literature.

## Original Project Context

The baseline rule-based system was developed as an undergraduate final year project at FUTO (2020):
- **Institution:** Federal University of Technology Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Stanley Obilor, B.Sc. (Nig.), M.Sc (FUTO), Ph.D (Nig), MNSE, MNICE, MNIWE
- **Original system:** PHP-based web application with MySQL database
- **Current enhancement:** Complete redesign with Python, LLM integration, and rigorous evaluation

## Manuscript Statistics

- **Word count:** ~4,500 words (excluding references)
- **Abstract:** 420 words (within 450-word limit)
- **Tables:** 2
- **Figures:** 3 (confusion matrices, accuracy comparison, system architecture)
- **References:** 30 (recent, relevant literature)
- **Supplementary materials:** 3 appendices

## Why JMIR Medical Informatics?

Your journal's open-access model ensures our findings reach healthcare workers in malaria-endemic regions who would benefit most from this technology. The rapid review process aligns with our goal of timely dissemination to inform clinical practice and future research in AI-enhanced healthcare for resource-limited settings.

We believe this manuscript will be of significant interest to your readership, particularly those working in AI-enhanced healthcare, global health informatics, clinical decision support systems, and digital health implementation in low- and middle-income countries.

Thank you for considering our manuscript. I look forward to your feedback and am prepared to address reviewer comments promptly.
