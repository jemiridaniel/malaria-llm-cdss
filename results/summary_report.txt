MALARIA DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM EVALUATION SUMMARY
======================================================================

DATASET STATISTICS:
- Total Cases Evaluated: 1,682
- No Malaria: 455
- Stage I (Uncomplicated): 1,089
- Stage II (Moderate): 118
- Critical: 20

OVERALL PERFORMANCE:
- Baseline Accuracy: 30.62%
- LLM-Enhanced Accuracy: 87.22%
- Absolute Improvement: +56.60 percentage points
- Relative Improvement: 184.9%

KEY FINDINGS:
1. The LLM-enhanced system demonstrates substantial improvement over the 
   rule-based baseline across all severity stages.

2. Critical case detection is crucial for patient safety - both systems
   show strong performance in this category.

3. The hybrid approach (rules + LLM) combines the reliability of 
   deterministic classification with the flexibility of AI reasoning.

4. Natural language explanations provided by the LLM add clinical value
   beyond simple diagnostic labels.

CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
The 56.6% improvement in diagnostic accuracy could translate to:
- Better triage decisions in resource-limited settings
- Reduced misclassification of malaria severity
- Enhanced decision support for non-specialist healthcare workers
- Improved patient outcomes through appropriate treatment escalation
